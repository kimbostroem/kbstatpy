### Features

- Initial release. Python library for generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis, modelled after the MATLAB kbstat library, with model fitting via R's lme4, glmmTMB, and emmeans (through pymer4 and rpy2).
- Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with Kenward-Roger / Satterthwaite degrees of freedom, Type III sums of squares, and effects-coded contrasts.
- Data transformation with automatic back-transformation of estimates for plots and tables.
- Standalone correlation analysis (Pearson and partial) and multicollinearity diagnostics (Variance Inflation Factor).
- Support for multiple dependent variables (multi-y) in a single call, with family-wise correction across them.
- Demo scripts on classic R datasets (demos/) and a run_demos.py runner.
