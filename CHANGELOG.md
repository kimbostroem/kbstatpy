# Changes

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-30

### Bugs

- Data-plot suptitle no longer overlaps the top row of panels on tall faceted figures (e.g. one row per subject). It is anchored a constant physical distance above the panels — matching the diagnostics plot — instead of at a fixed figure fraction.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Features

- Connecting lines in the violin plots now span any number of factor levels (previously only two), tracing each subject's points across adjacent levels by identity.

### Bugs

- Connecting lines now tolerate outlier removal: a flagged point drops only the line segments touching it, rather than suppressing the lines for the whole panel. Pairing is now by subject id instead of by matching data values, which also fixes mis-connections when two subjects share a value.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-26

### Features

- Initial release. Python library for generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis, modelled after the MATLAB kbstat library, with model fitting via R's lme4, glmmTMB, and emmeans (through pymer4 and rpy2).
- Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with Kenward-Roger / Satterthwaite degrees of freedom, Type III sums of squares, and effects-coded contrasts.
- Data transformation with automatic back-transformation of estimates for plots and tables.
- Standalone correlation analysis (Pearson and partial) and multicollinearity diagnostics (Variance Inflation Factor).
- Support for multiple dependent variables (multi-y) in a single call, with family-wise correction across them.
- Demo scripts on classic R datasets (demos/) and a run_demos.py runner.
